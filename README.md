# MDC2019: Structured Logging with Serilog in .NET Core

https://mdc.ilmservice.com/sessions/

<i>Structured logging gives you the context needed to get answers to complex questions from your logs.

In this talk, you will learn how to get started with Serilog, the top open-source logging library for .NET Core today. We will cover the basics so you can get going immediately, and some not-so-basic scenarios so you can see how to deal with difficult situations. Do logs need to end up in a database, email, or messaging service? We cover how to easily do that too.</i>
